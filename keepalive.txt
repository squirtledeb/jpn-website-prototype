# Keepalive Instructions for Uptime Robot

To keep your Render deployment always on, use Uptime Robot to ping your website at regular intervals.

## Steps:
1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com/
2. Create a free account (if you don't have one).
3. Add a new monitor:
   - Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
   - Friendly Name: Your Website Keepalive
   - URL: https://your-render-app-url.onrender.com/
   - Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes (default)
4. Save the monitor.

Uptime Robot will ping your site every 5 minutes, preventing it from sleeping.
